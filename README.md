🧑‍💻 Author: Rahul Balijapally
🎯 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset to uncover meaningful insights such as sales trends, customer behavior, and top-performing products and regions.

🧭 Steps Involved
1️⃣ Database Exploration

Reviewed database structure and relationships.

Understood table connections between facts and dimensions.

Checked data quality, column names, and data types.

2️⃣ Dimensions Exploration

Analyzed dimension tables such as customers, products, and geography.

Understood key attributes that describe each entity.

Verified consistency and uniqueness of dimension keys.

3️⃣ Date Exploration<img width="2141" height="916" alt="Project Roadmap" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49ce6fd9-360c-4e05-84cb-02c2888f22dc" />


Examined date-related columns like order_date, shipping_date, and due_date.

Identified trends, seasons, and time-based variations in sales.

Ensured proper formatting and completeness of date values.

4️⃣ Measures Exploration

Explored measurable fields like sales amount, quantity, and price.

Identified key performance indicators (KPIs).

Focused on “big numbers” — total sales, revenue, and overall performance metrics.

5️⃣ Magnitude Analysis

Compared the magnitude of sales across countries and products.

Discovered which regions and categories contribute most to total sales.

Visualized large vs. small contributors to understand overall balance.

6️⃣ Ranking Analysis

Determined Top N and Bottom N performers.

Ranked products, customers, and countries based on total sales.

Highlighted top-selling and least-selling entities for business focus.

🧩 Outcome

Clear understanding of data distribution and relationships.

Identification of top-performing products and regions.

Found areas of improvement for low-performing customers and categories.

Ready for further predictive analysis or dashboard visualization.

🪶 Summary

This EDA provided valuable business insights by exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the data step-by-step.
It sets the foundation for data-driven decision-making and future analytics models.
