🧑‍💻 Author: Rahul Balijapally
🎯 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset to uncover meaningful insights such as sales trends, customer behavior, and top-performing products and regions.

🧭 Steps Involved
1️⃣ Database Exploration

Reviewed database structure and relationships.

Understood table connections between facts and dimensions.

Checked data quality, column names, and data types.

4️⃣ Measures Exploration

Explored measurable fields like sales amount, quantity, and price.

Identified key performance indicators (KPIs).

Focused on “big numbers” — total sales, revenue, and overall performance metrics.

5️⃣ Magnitude Analysis

Compared the magnitude of sales across countries and products.

Ranked products, customers, and countries based on total sales.

Highlighted top-selling and least-selling entities for business focus.

🧩 Outcome

Clear understanding of data distribution and relationships.

Identification of top-performing products and regions.

Found areas of improvement for low-performing customers and categories.

Ready for further predictive analysis or dashboard visualization.

🪶 Summary

This EDA provided valuable business insights by exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the data step-by-step.
It sets the foundation for data-driven decision-making and future analytics models.
